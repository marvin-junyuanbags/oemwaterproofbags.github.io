                    <section id="materials">
                        <h2>Waterproof Materials and Technologies</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Primary Waterproof Materials</h3>
                        <p>The foundation of any effective waterproof backpack lies in its materials. Modern manufacturers utilize several advanced materials, each with unique properties and applications:</p>
                        
                        <h4>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)</h4>
                        <p>PVC remains one of the most popular choices for waterproof backpacks due to its excellent water resistance, durability, and cost-effectiveness. PVC-coated fabrics provide complete waterproofing while maintaining flexibility and strength. However, PVC can be heavier than alternatives and may become stiff in cold temperatures.</p>
                        
                        <h4>TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)</h4>
                        <p>TPU represents the next generation of waterproof materials, offering superior flexibility, abrasion resistance, and temperature stability compared to PVC. TPU-coated fabrics maintain their waterproof properties across a wider temperature range and are generally more environmentally friendly than PVC alternatives.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Nylon with Waterproof Coatings</h4>
                        <p>High-denier nylon fabrics treated with specialized waterproof coatings provide an excellent balance of weight, durability, and water resistance. These materials often feature multiple coating layers to ensure complete waterproofing while maintaining breathability where needed.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Welded Seam Technology</h4>
                        <p>Beyond material selection, the construction method significantly impacts waterproof performance. Welded seam technology uses heat and pressure to create watertight bonds between fabric pieces, eliminating the needle holes that traditional stitching creates. This process ensures that seams become the strongest, most waterproof part of the backpack rather than potential failure points.</p>
