                    <p>The foundation of any emergency bag is its waterproof capability. Look for bags with IPX7 or higher ratings, welded seams, and roll-top closures that provide complete water protection even during submersion.</p>
                    
                    <h3>📦 Organization Systems</h3>
                    <p>Effective emergency bags feature multiple compartments, clear pouches, and organizational systems that allow quick access to specific supplies during high-stress situations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>💪 Durability Construction</h3>
                    <p>Emergency bags must withstand harsh conditions. Premium bags use military-grade materials, reinforced stress points, and heavy-duty zippers designed for repeated use under extreme conditions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🎒 Comfort Features</h3>
                    <p>During evacuations, comfort matters. Quality emergency bags include padded straps, ergonomic designs, and weight distribution systems that reduce fatigue during extended carry periods.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🔦 Visibility Elements</h3>
                    <p>Emergency situations often occur in low-light conditions. The best bags incorporate reflective strips, bright colors, and attachment points for emergency lighting.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🔧 Modular Compatibility</h3>
                    <p>Advanced emergency bags feature MOLLE systems or modular attachments that allow customization and expansion based on specific emergency scenarios and family needs.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Essential items include water (1 gallon per person per day), non-perishable food for 72 hours, first aid supplies, medications, flashlight, battery-powered radio, extra batteries, copies of important documents, cash, emergency contact information, and weather-appropriate clothing.</div>
